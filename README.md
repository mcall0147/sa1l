## Description 
This is a web application that allows a user to search for a song and artist. It will dynamically generate a YouTube video of the song, the lyrics, information about the song, as well as similar songs. Past searches are cataloged in local storage and are generated with buttons and displayed on the website for quick reference. The lyrics are displayed through the use of a modal. Lyrics, song info, and similar songs are all dynamically generated in JavaScript via the Musixmatch API, the Audio DB API, and the Genius API. 

## How to Use 
Enter the song and artist you want to look up and click search. The information will then populate in its appropriate locations. To see the lyrics of the song, click on the button that says "See Song Lyrics." To refer back to a recent search, click on the song under the recent searches that you want to return to.
